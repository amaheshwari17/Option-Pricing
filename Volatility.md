Historical volatility

Historical volatility indicates the deviation or change in prices of the underlying asset over a given period of time in past. 
Usually, historical volatility is calculated over a period of one-year i.e. 252 trading days. 
It is used by traders to compare the current volatility level of an underlying asset with its historical volatility. 
The issue with historical volatility is that it is a backwards-looking indicator which means it is based on the past returns and is not the most reliable form of volatility.
